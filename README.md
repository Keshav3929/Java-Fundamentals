# Java-Fundamentals
In this my main focus is on user input mechanism
# In this we'll be making a small basic structred tic-tac-toe game which will be made only using java.
1. In the first step we will be using our complete knowledge of user input through scanner and other functions and will be writing the code for it and keeping it way simple.
2. In the second step today we are writing the code of how the structure would be looking after code to the user experinece.
3. In the third step we are checking the flow of code and the error's.
Yep! It's ready
